# PersonalProjects
This is a project from a business intelligence class where we used a loan eligle dataset from kaggle for some exploratory analysis. My goal in this project was to build a simple model and create some 
visualizations where possible. I plan to build upon this base by adding more model's to try and improve prediction scores.
